										&nbsp;
										<p>Intracerebral hematoma (ICH) is the second most common type of stroke, and the most deadilest. It is a
											spontaneous and urgent event, where a blood vessel ruptures inside the brain and causes bleeding, 
											eventually forming a clot. Surgical evacuation of the clot through stereotactic aspiration is done to
											manage this condition, but unfortunately postoperative re-bleeding can occur and hinder patient
											outcomes, namely increased mortality. My capstone team worked with a neurotrauma surgeon at the
											University of Maryland Medical Center to research and develop an injectable biomaterial that could be
											inserted in the clot cavity to act as a temporary scaffold as the brain tissue heals post-operation.

										</p>
										<p>The capstone project gave me experience solving a real-world biomedical problem in a small team,
											developing my communication abilities by collaborating with doctors and bioengineering faculty
											members and presenting the project to various audiences. Alongside developing my ability to perform
											scientific research and writing, I was able to apply my interest in computer science by creating a
											MATLAB app with a GUI that allows users to perform several relevant biomaterial calculations by 
											inputting their values.
