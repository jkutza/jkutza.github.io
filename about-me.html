								<p>Hi! My name is Joseph Kutza, and I’m an undergraduate bioengineering student at the University of Maryland, College Park. I enjoy understanding biological 
									phenomena through a quantitative perspective. My interest in biology stems from my childhood, where I was often afflicted with various illnesses and spent time 
									in and out of the healthcare system. My mom likes to tell the story of how I was the only preschooler who played with calendars, and also found joy in summing 
									random three-digit numbers given to me. I was fascinated with how things worked, taking apart devices and reassembling them. In high school, I built my first 
									PC using money I saved working as a robotics teacher at a summer camp. When I entered the University of Maryland, College Park right before the Covid 
									pandemic in 2019, I wanted to apply my interest in working with numbers and machines, enrolling in the mechanical engineering program. However, after 
									joining a computational biology lab in 2021, I switched to bioengineering and haven’t looked back. I’m thrilled at the prospect of using biocomputational 
									techniques to improve the outcomes and lives of sick patients, just as I was as a child.</p>

								<p>As a Maryland native, I enjoy the diversity of the state in both its people and its wildlife. My interest in life sciences and ecology is exemplified by my time working 
									for the Maryland Park Service during 2021 and 2022. I love nature and spending time outdoors, whether I’m walking on a trail by myself or taking a weekend trip 
									with my friends. I also like to draw, a skill which was developed over nine years of classes at an art center in the area, where I would eventually work as a robotics 
									teacher for one summer. I write and brainstorm ideas, particularly when coding, on sketch pads to visualize the goal and give a roadmap for when I go to 
									write the program. </p>
